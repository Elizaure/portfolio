			<h2>Professional Thesis</h2>
	<p>My thesis searchs to understand how to enhance empathy between professionals and users by a-day-in-a-life-of method. Alike this IDEO designer, Kristian Simsarian which admitted imself as 'a patient', this experience should provoke a big change in the way of thinking users of professionnals.</p>
	<p>However, there is no strong study of which conditions are required and enough to make append this new state of mind. So, I aim to identify the conditions which provoke this change in the state of mind of decision makers.</p>
			<h2>User Experience</h2>
	<p>I had some class of Ergonomics in recent years. Professionals teached us what is user experience, how to assess it and how to adapt interfaces to human.</p>
	<p>So I had observed a students focus group, created a micro-usability test (you can see extract at the right), created a test card and test a website. All these methods have served us to make some recommendations to improve products and services.</p>
			<h2>Work Psychologist</h2>
	<p>As a professional, I intervened on differents missions which needed to identify the problems, the needs and make some recommendation to improve the subject's situation.</p>
	<p>I received some professionals in face-to-face interview and some services in groups interviews.</p>
			<h2>Anthropology</h2>
	<p>This year we also had some classes in Anthropology. In addition to deepen my knowledge about user with an another perspective, I, with my teammate, applied with a concrete study about an specific activity :Warhammer hobbyists.</p>
	<p>We observed them during the painting process and questionned them to identify a pain point and how to improve the process with an innovation (you can click on the image to see our website)<br><br><br></p>

We presented all our findings to the Eurovia's group project and during a creative meeting, we identified some working axes. Now we are gathering our knowledge to delve into our innovative solutions by identify the conditions of application and prototyping them.</p>
