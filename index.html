		<h1>Users Needs Projects</h1>
			<h2>Professional Thesis</h2>
	<p>I search to understand how to enhance empathy between professionals and users by a-day-in-a-life-of method. Alike this IDEO designer, K. Simsarian which admitted imself as 'a patient', this experience should provoke a big change in the way of thinking users. However, there is no strong evidences about conditions required to make append this new state of mind. So, I aim to identify the conditions which provoke this change in the state of mind of decision makers.</p>
			<h2>User Experience</h2>
	<p>I had some class of Ergonomics in recent years. Professionals teached us what is user experience, how to assess it and how to adapt interfaces to human. So I had observed a students focus group, created a micro-usability test (you can see an extract at the right), created a test card and test a website. All these methods have served to make some recommendations to improve products and services.</p>
			<h2>Work Psychologist</h2>
	<p>As a professional, I intervened on differents missions which needed to identify the problems, the needs and make some recommendation to improve the subject's situation. I received some professionals in face-to-face interview and some services in groups interviews.</p>
			<h2>Anthropology</h2>
	<p>This year we also had some classes in Anthropology. In addition to deepen my knowledge about user with an another perspective, I, with my teammate, applied with a concrete study about an specific activity :Warhammer hobbyists.We observed them during the painting process and questionned them to identify a pain point and how to improve the process with an innovation (click on the image to see our website).</p>
