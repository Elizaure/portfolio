		<h1>Users Needs Projects</h1>
			<h2>Professional Thesis</h2>
	<p>My thesis searchs to understand how to enhance empathy between professionals and their users by a-day-in-a-life-of method. Indeed, nowadays a lot of design agencies put marketers, CEO and others professionals with their users to live their lives. Alike this IDEO designer, Kristian Simsarian which admitted imself as 'a patient', this experience should provoke a big change in the way of thinking users of professionnals.</p>
	<p>However, there is no strong study of which conditions are required and enough to make append this new state of mind.</p>
	<p>So, by my study, I want to identify the conditions which provoke this change in the state of mind of decision makers.</p>

		  <h2>Work Psychologist</h2>
	<p>As a professional, I intervened on differents missions which needed to identify the problems, the needs and make some recommendation to improve the subject's situation.</p>
	<p>Therefore in Orange and in GCS, I received some professionals in face-to-face interview and some services in groups interviews.These situations were about difficulties at work, difficulties with colleagues, kind of mobbing or burnout.</p>
	<p>I also received some services during groups. I intervened with them to find out their actual problems, identify the sources of their difficulties.</p>

		  <h2>User Experience</h2>
	<p>This year and during my last year of my psychology' specialisation, we had some class of Ergonomics. Different professionals teached us what is user experience, how to assess it and how to adapt interfaces to human.</p>
	<p>So I had observed a students focus group, created a micro-usability test and passed this along to other students, created a test card and test a website. All these methods have served us to make some recommendations to improve products and services.</p>
	<p>Furthermore, I also took a MOOC : Introduction to UX of Michigan Research and Design University. 2 submissions were about a micro-usability test of Doodle.com and sketch 10 different ideas for how an interface for a 10000 floors elevator might work.</p>
