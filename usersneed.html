			<h2>Professional Thesis</h2>
	<p>My thesis searchs to understand how to enhance empathy between professionals and their users by a-day-in-a-life-of method. Alike this IDEO designer, Kristian Simsarian which admitted imself as 'a patient', this experience should provoke a big change in the way of thinking users of professionnals.</p>
	<p>However, there is no strong study of which conditions are required and enough to make append this new state of mind.So, by my study, I aim to identify the conditions which provoke this change in the state of mind of decision makers.</p>

		  <h2>User Experience</h2>

	<p>So I had observed a students focus group, created a micro-usability test (you can see an work extract by the video to the right), created a test card and test a website. All these methods have served us to make some recommendations to improve products and services.</p>
